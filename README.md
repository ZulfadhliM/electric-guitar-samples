# Electric Guitar Samples

This dataset is used in [[1]](#Reference) and [[2]](#Reference) for estimating the performance parameter of an electric guitar, particularly the pickup and plucking positions.

To clone this dataset, Git LFS needs to be installed. See [docs](https://help.github.com/en/articles/installing-git-large-file-storage).
